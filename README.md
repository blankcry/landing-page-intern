single page Landing page created in React for internship opportunity 
1. Discuss briefly why you chose the Language and or framework. 

  a. Simplicity
      ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn,
      build a professional web (and mobile applications), and support it. React uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript. This is not 
      a requirement; Developer can still write in plain JavaScript but JSX is much easier to use.
 
  b. Easy to learn
 
      Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React while Angular and Ember are referred to as ‘Domain-specific Language’, implying that it
      is difficult to learn them. To react, you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.
 
  c. Native Approach

      React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native). And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. So at the same 
      time, we can make IOS, Android and Web applications.
      
2. Discuss briefly your choice of design elements such as colors and fonts. 
      My choice of color and fonts were based on what would catch the eye, as a fintech site, it should be able to capture the eyes of the page visitors, allowing them to concentrate 
      on what the page is saying whilst not making them carried away.
